random module

The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

 ##here are some useful functions for Random module##

1.Randint:

If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters

2.Choice:

Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

3.Shuffle

The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

4.Randrange

Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

# RISK: The probability of any unwanted incident.

Risk analysis :in software testing is an approach to software testing where software risk is analyzed and measured.

risk it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

examples of possible risks that you could encounter:

Use of new hardware
Use of new technology
Use of new automation tool
The sequence of code
Availability of test resources for the application
##Risk Identification##

There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:

Business Risks

Testing Risks

Premature Release Risk
 
software Risk

  Test coverage

Test coverage is defined as a technique which determines whether our test cases are actually covering the application code and how much code is exercised when we run those test cases.

   ## why test coverage is important:##

1.You can identify gaps in requirements, test cases and defects at early stages of your product development life cycle 2.Test coverage helps you unearth areas of a program that have not been covered by a set of test cases3.You can prevent defect leakage using Test coverage analysis.
