# Stack

A Stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) principle.
# To implement a stack, we need two simple operations:

push - It adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop - It removes an element from the top of the stack.

# Operations:

Adding - It adds the items in the stack and increases the stack size. The addition takes place at the top of the stack.
Deletion - It consists of two conditions, first, if no element is present in the stack, then underflow occurs in the stack, and second, if a stack contains some elements, then the topmost element gets removed. It reduces the stack size.
Traversing - It involves visiting each element of the stack.

Top - This is the top of the stack.
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false



Stacks follow these concepts:

First In Last Out

# Queue

A Queue follows the First-in-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is opened from both the ends hence we can easily add elements to the back and can remove elements from the front.

# To implement a queue, we need two simple operations:

enqueue - It adds an element to the end of the queue.
dequeue - It removes the element from the beginning of the queue.

# Operations on Queue

Addition - It adds the element in a queue and takes place at the rear end, i.e., at the back of the queue.
Deletion - It consists of two conditions - If no element is present in the queue, Underflow occurs in the queue, or if a stack contains some elements then element present at the front gets deleted.
Traversing - It involves to visit each element of the queue.
Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
