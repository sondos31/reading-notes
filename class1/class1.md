# BIG(O) NOTATION 

Big O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates: different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same O notation. The letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the order of the function. A description of a function in terms of big O notation usually only provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the function.

 BIG O is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

O( l ): algorthim executes in the same time.

O( N ): algorthim performance grows lineraly with the size of the input.

O( N ^ 2): algorthim performance proportional to the square of the input.

O(2 ^ N): algorthim performance doubles with each addition to the input.
