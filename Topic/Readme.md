Classes and Objects
Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects

Recursive Functions in Python
Now that we have some intuition about recursion, let’s introduce the formal definition of a recursive function. A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

To demonstrate this structure, let’s write a recursive function for calculating n!:

Decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem. This is the recursive case:

# Maintaining State
When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
Keep the state in global scope
A demonstration should make things clearer. Let’s calculate 1 + 2 + 3 ⋅⋅⋅⋅ + 10 using recursion. The state that we have to maintain is (current number we are adding, accumulated sum till now).

Here’s how you do that by threading it through each recursive call (i.e. passing the updated current state to each recursive call as arguments)


# Naive Recursion is Naive
The Fibonacci numbers were originally deﬁned by the Italian mathematician Fibonacci in the thirteenth century to model the growth of rabbit populations. Fibonacci surmised that the number of pairs of rabbits born in a given year is equal to the number of pairs of rabbits born in each of the two previous years, starting from one pair of rabbits in the ﬁrst year.

# Fin
I was once asked to explain recursion in an interview. I took a sheet of paper and wrote Please turn over on both sides. The interviewer didn’t get the joke, but now that you have read this article, hopefully you do 🙂 Happy Pythoning!
