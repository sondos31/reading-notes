# Data visualization 
 Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets. The term is often used interchangeably with others, including information graphics, information visualization and statistical graphics

Data visualization is one of the steps of the data science process, which states that after data has been collected, processed and modeled, it must be visualized for conclusions to be made. Data visualization is also an element of the broader data presentation architecture (DPA) discipline, which aims to identify, locate, manipulate, format and deliver data in the most efficient way possible.

Data visualization is important for almost every career. It can be used by teachers to display student test results, by computer scientists exploring advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) or by executives looking to share information with stakeholders. It also plays an important role in big data projects. As businesses accumulated massive collections of data during the early years of the big data trend, they needed a way to quickly and easily get an overview of their data. Visualization tools were a natural fit.

Visualization is central to advanced analytics for similar reasons. When a data scientist is writing advanced predictive analytics or machine learning (ML) algorithms, it becomes important to visualize the outputs to monitor results and ensure that models are performing as intended. This is because visualizations of complex algorithms are generally easier to interpret than numerical outputs.

# Why is data visualization important?
Data visualization provides a quick and effective way to communicate information in a universal manner using visual information. The practice can also help businesses identify which factors affect customer behavior; pinpoint areas that need to be improved or need more attention; make data more memorable for stakeholders; understand when and where to place specific products; and predict sales volumes.

# benefits of data visualization include the following:

the ability to absorb information quickly, improve insights and make faster decisions;
an increased understanding of the next steps that must be taken to improve the organization;
an improved ability to maintain the audience's interest with information they can understand;
an easy distribution of information that increases the opportunity to share insights with everyone involved;
eliminate the need for data scientists since data is more accessible and understandable; and
an increased ability to act on findings quickly and, therefore, achieve success with greater speed and less mistakes.
Data visualization and big data
The increased popularity of big data and data analysis projects have made visualization more important than ever. Companies are increasingly using machine learning to gather massive amounts of data that can be difficult and slow to sort through, comprehend and explain. Visualization offers a means to speed this up and present information to business owners and stakeholders in ways they can understand.

Big data visualization often goes beyond the typical techniques used in normal visualization, such as pie charts, histograms and corporate graphs. It instead uses more complex representations, such as heat maps and fever charts. Big data visualization requires powerful computer systems to collect raw data, process it and turn it into graphical representations that humans can use to quickly draw insights.

While big data visualization can be beneficial, it can pose several disadvantages to organizations. They are as follows:

To get the most out of big data visualization tools, a visualization specialist must be hired. This specialist must be able to identify the best data sets and visualization styles to guarantee organizations are optimizing the use of their data.
Big data visualization projects often require involvement from IT, as well as management, since the visualization of big data requires powerful computer hardware, efficient storage systems and even a move to the cloud.
The insights provided by big data visualization will only be as accurate as the information being visualized. Therefore, it is essential to have people and processes in place to govern and control the quality of corporate data, metadata and data sources.
# Examples of data visualization
In the early days of visualization, the most common visualization technique was using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to transform the information into a table, bar graph or pie chart. While these visualization methods are still commonly used, more intricate techniques are now available, including the following:

infographics
bubble clouds
bullet graphs
heat maps
fever charts
time series charts
Some other popular techniques are as follows.

Line charts. This is one of the most basic and common techniques used. Line charts display how variables can change over time.

Area charts. This visualization method is a variation of a line chart; it displays multiple values in a time series -- or a sequence of data collected at consecutive, equally spaced points in time.

Scatter plots. This technique displays the relationship between two variables. A scatter plot takes the form of an x- and y-axis with dots to represent data points.

Treemaps. This method shows hierarchical data in a nested format. The size of the rectangles used for each category is proportional to its percentage of the whole. Treemaps are best used when multiple categories are present, and the goal is to compare different parts of a whole.

Population pyramids. This technique uses a stacked bar graph to display the complex social narrative of a population. It is best used when trying to display the distribution of a population.
