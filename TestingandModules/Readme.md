# Unit tests
Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want

# Baby Steps
The API is pretty straightforward and your work was almost done. But with TDD we need to think about tests first. And to be ok with the possibility of the beginning to be hard sometimes ‚Äî and it‚Äôs totally fine

# A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.

Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

# The cycle is made by three steps:

üÜò Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn‚Äôt there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
‚úÖ Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
üîµ Refactor the code ‚Äî the first version doesn‚Äôt need to be the beautiful one (don‚Äôt be shy)



# What does the if __name__ == ‚Äú__main__‚Äù: do?
Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. 
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value ‚Äú__main__‚Äù. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module‚Äôs name. Module‚Äôs name is available as value to __name__ global variable. 

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. 

# Advantages : 

Every Python module has it‚Äôs __name__ defined and if this is ‚Äò__main__‚Äô, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
if __name__ == ‚Äúmain‚Äù: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

# What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function
A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems.
Need of Recursion

# Need of Recursion

Recursion is an amazing technique with the help of which we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write. 

# Properties of Recursion:

Performing the same operations multiple times with different inputs.
In every step, we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
Base condition is needed to stop the recursion otherwise infinite loop will occur
