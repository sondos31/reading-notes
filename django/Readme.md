# django
Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram.
Django was originally developed at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss. The code was open-sourced in 2005


# Django Software Foundation
The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. The largest expense, by far, is the Fellows Program, paid contractors who triage tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work needed to keep Django on track.

Tim Graham was the inaugural fellow during its 3-month pilot in the fall of 2014 and became a full-time fellow in 2015. He remained in this role until 2018 before transitioning to a part-time role. Carlton Gibson joined as a part-time Fellow in 2018 and in 2019 Mariusz Felisiak took over from Tim Graham.

The Django Fellows do incredible, behind-the-scenes work for the community. You can hear podcast interviews with both Tim Graham and Marius Felisiak for more context.

The DSF also supports projects related to Django such as the Kickstarters for Django REST Framework 3, improved PostgreSQL support, among others. It supports related conferences that promote Django and provides funding to extend access to a diverse group of developers. Manages things such as the recent redesign of the main Django website, and more. You can see a 2014 roundup for a broader sense.

The DSF itself is run by a Board of Directors, who are elected annually by the ~180 individual members appointed by the DSF in recognition of their service to the Django community.

If you make a donation to Django–and if you’re using Django professionally you really should–that money goes to the DSF. The majority goes to the Django Fellows who ensure the project remains on track and the rest helps promote Django and expand its community. The total budget for the DSF in 2019 is around $200,000, or less than the cost of a single Bay Area Django engineer.


# Technical Organization
The DSF handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. But there is a separate organizational structure for the technical team.

Historically, Django followed Python’s model of having a Benevolent Dictator for Life, that is, a project founder who retained final say for disputes/arguments within the community. 


# Conclusion
So where does this Django behind the scenes tour leave us? Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.
